** Bayesian probability
*** Probabilities represent sates of knowledge or belief
*** Bayesian interpretation of probability
**** extension of propositional logic
**** hypothesis are assigned probability
*** Provides formula that
**** takes specified prior probability
**** which is then updated to posterior
***** in light of new evidence
*** Methodology
**** use of random variables to model uncertainty
**** requires /prior probability distribution/ taking in to account the available information
**** sequential use of Bayes' formula
***** when more data available
***** calculate posterior distribution -> becomes next prior
***** probability assigned to hypothesis is 0-1
