* Computing needs expanding at both levels
high level - human interaction
low level - performance 


** CC community desires

*** framing info 
**** performance
 hypothetical SC server spawning example
**** interaction
actually be able to explain stuff in a meaningful way

In many systems evaluation impacts future actions
In computing this is true in many sense but not all
How can evaluation of a situation impact future processing?
- Occurs in if/case statements etc
- State

But creative evaluation?
* All actions are creative, it's the evaluator that tells us why
In many cases that is us.
* Evaluator frames - actor creates
* Does creativity come from whatever occurs to us first?

* Creativity is a side effect not a process?
side effect's are typically undesirable
what i mean is creativity is not focus of system
it is a side effect of how system works
** evolution has no purpsose
*** yet it's *created* more than any other system
**** it's output is novel due to the means in which it copies
**** its output is useful because of survival of the fittest
***** who is to sa y what's useful when it comes to being alive?
****** failed mutations = disabled people
*** whats the reason evolution hasn't been evolved past?
**** it's a particularly robust system
* Barliman

Logic programming - used to produce functional programs
Is it creative?
* Google's zero-shot learning

learning korean without having been exposed to it
* Game theory and machine learning

** NN compete

*** adversarial network
**** has a 
***** generator

****** creates fake images

***** discriminator

****** detects fake images

**** no closed loss function required

**** difficult to train

***** Got to find a Nash Equilibrium

** Classical view ML

*** Problems cast as optimisation problem

**** searching for optimal solution

*** Optimising - over fits

**** we want to preform well on data we haven't yet seen

***** generalisation

***** to stop over-fir we use regularisations

*** Regularisation

**** structural risk minimisation

*** generalisation strategies built in manner similar to how parties mitigate risk

A good meme is a meme that doesn't close its cycles

Goedel's incomenserability theorem

Preserve a lack of closure

Open endedness is a threat

Dominator model seeks finality

Wouldn't want substance affects to affect him during the day
Radically different from ordinary reality


Mystical experience - the flight of the alone


** Novelty - as Quality to reality 

*** Knits the world together
- creates new emergent properties out of the densification of previous states of existence
- morally neutral force
- tendency in universe for complexity to conserve itself
- build lower levels of complexity in to higher levels of organisation


** Novelty more and more in world
* Any rule bound game can be played by a machine
** Mechanical turk

Some one controls machine.
Person knows how to play chess.
Machine is not creative/intelligent etc.

** Chinese box

Man sits in box
Imitates a machine
Has instructions on how to respond to each utterance
Includes whole chinese language

** Turing tests 
Computer imitates person

* Systems that lie

** Easy 

*** Puts person or concept in to another story

Simple word swap
* AARON criticised for finger prints but now hes dead
** but now Cohen's creativity only exists in system
* It's silly to differentiate between process and artefact since processes are artefacts?
