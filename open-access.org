* Open Access
** Old problem 
*** Printing/distribution was expensive
*** Journals upped price
**** Outpaced inflation by long way
**** Poor countries people/can't afford
*** Digitisation
*** Don't know whats relevant until after you've paid for it
*** Journal affordability problem
**** "Even if all journals were sold at cost price, almost no university could afford all or even most of them."
*** research access/impact problem
**** impact of many articles is lost

** What is it?
*** Online research
**** Free of access restrictions/tolls
**** Free to reuse
***** Mine articles
**** Peer reviewed/sometimes not

** Main impediment
*** Scientists
**** Slow to adopt
**** Want nature paper

** Different options
*** Gold open access
**** Truly open-access
**** Can be provided by same people that offer subscription-based journals
**** Sometimes charge authors - 30% of them
***** research funder pays
***** sometimes waived for
****** financial hardship
****** less developed countries
**** Sometime advertising used

*** Green open access
**** Deposit articles in institution archive
**** Give green light to self-archiving
**** Endorse immediate access self-archiving
**** No charge
***** Less risk to publisher
**** Nature prefer it to Gold?
***** Not sure why?

*** How do we publish at both Nature and Open Access?
**** Is that possible?
***** Yes
* Finch report
** recommended a balanced programme of action to enable more people to read and use the publications arising from research, and to accelerate the progress towards a fully open access environment.
** UK should move to gold standard publishing
*** Other channels useful for time being
** Research councils UK
*** Cover publishing costs for gold-access
** Everything submitted as REF should be as open as possible
* RCUK follow Finch report. Provide funding
* HEFCE - Higher education funding council
** Rules about how open papers have to be to be included in REF
** Green will do?
