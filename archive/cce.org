** FACE can generate framing information
*** Does it leave room fro this to exist already?
**** i.e. in code?

** Is eval a component of C?
** Is eval the dual of C?

*** If so does creativity fail?

**** Can an act of creativity fail?

***** Or is it simple evaluated as such?

** Is evaluation separate to thing it's evaluating?

*** Is this FACE and IDEA split?

**** yes

** Reflection

*** Super useful

*** Nothing to do with creative process

*** Humans can choose to follow algorithms

*** Free will


* Is interaction really required to frame output
