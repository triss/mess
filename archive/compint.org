Hi Marek,

I'd love to meet Nick if possible. I'm a new PhD student looking at the role of evaluation in creative systems. I'm particularly interested in how potentially useful methods are found when observing data.

** How are new suitable methods for analysing a given data set selected?

*** what analysis is done to ensure methods is being usefully applied?

*** how is this measured?

** Could same be done for visualisation and other representations i.e. sonification, poetry?

** It's often said that GOFAI techniques might have worked if they could only get big enough

*** Perhaps theres some indication that this is true?
