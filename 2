* Misztal, 2014 - Poetry generation system with an emotional personality
cite:Misztal2014
** Summary
*** Write poetry systems inspired by thoughts and emotions
*** An "emphatic system" - mood influenced by text
** Content
*** Abstract
**** Multi-agent blackboard system for poetry generation
**** Focus on emotional modelling
**** Poems inspired by blog posts
***** Change mood of system
**** Experts with distinct roles
***** cooperate via blackboard model
**** Evaluation performed on process and outputs
*** Introduction
**** Lister, 1949 - sonnet composed of
***** "thoughts and emotions felt"
***** not "the chance fall of symbols"
**** An "emphatic system" 
***** mood influenced by text
***** David, 1983 - observers emotional state is impacted by others
**** "computational empathy"
* Gervas, 2009 - Computational Approaches to Storytelling and Creativity
** Summary
** Content
*** Creative process
**** Make something new, unexpected or different - Novel
Affected by expectations - knowledge of canon, or what creators or creator has done before.
**** Has particular goal - Value
**** Must have a result - output - that can be percieved or evaluated
***** Requires second agent?
**** Reqs for creativity different per medium
**** Engineering CC
***** Consider IO and feedback
Working material can be considered input
New inputs can influence novelty of output "with little intervention from the creative process employed".

*** Features of interest in a Story
Stories "difficult to specify"
**** Literary theory concepts
***** Minimal narrative
two states and a transition between the two states
***** Chronology
Time is basic element in stories.
***** Focalization
Story telling often restricted to "what might have been perceived by someone present in that scene."
Perception of space
Things taking place in different spaces require "different narrative threads".
***** Fabula
What is told. What narrative is.
events, actions, times, locations
***** Discourse
The way story is told.
arrangement, emphasis, deemphasis, magnification, dimminuation
*** CC
Same perspectives as everyone else -
**** Boden H and P creativity
**** Boden exploratory/transformative
**** Wiggins formalisation
**** Ritchie - self evaluation learnt from others
*** Story telling systems
**** Novel Writer - Klein, 1973
Murder stories - context of party
Probabilistic rules that changed state of the world
Interplay between characters fleshes out the plot
Choice of murderer and victim depended on traits provided as input
Motives arise as function of events in story
Focalisation "through he use of private semantic universe"
Did not look at using material from multiple universes.
***** Story grammar
Sequence of scenes was hardwired

**** Talespin - Meehan, 1977
***** Forward chaining
from events to their consequences
***** Backward chaining
"from desired outcomes expressed as goals that resulted from a previous event, to the particular events that will lead to the outcome"
***** Goals decomposed in to subgoals during backward chaining
***** Used "character goals as triggers for action"
***** More than one problem-solving character in story
***** Character perception - characters noticed
***** Maps of physical spaces
***** Modelled relations between characters
- competition
- dominace
- familiarity
- affection
- trust
- deceit
- indebtedness
**** Author - Dehn, 1981
***** Simulate author's mind as she makes up story
****** Claims that story worlds are developed post-hoc as justofcation for events
***** Meta-level goals drive or constrain the story
Story needs to be:
- consistent
- plausible
- believable
- retain reader's attention
***** Story is "the achievement of a complex web of author goals."
***** Successive reformulation as episodes unfold, of:
****** narrative goals
****** relationships between characters - chracter goals
***** Writing is "creative reasoning" as such includes:
****** Deliberate - achieve current goal
****** Surrendipitous - finding better goals to pursue as story unfolds
**** Universe - Leobowitz, 1983
***** Writers aid
***** Extended story generation - TV soap - ongoing
****** No recoginisable ending
***** Characters described independently of plot
unlike Dehn who was plot first
***** Author goals - not character goals
****** lead characters to undertake actions they would not have chosen as agents

**** Minstrel - Turner 1993
***** First system to "address specifically issues of creativity"
***** Based on source moral
***** Could create 10 stories of 1 and 1/2 pages in length
****** Or number of shorter stories
***** Constructed with goals + plans to satisfy them
****** Two levels
******* Author goals
******* Character goals
***** Planning stage and problem solving stage
****** Planning stage
******* Author level agenda and goals
****** Problem solving stage
******* Adds ingredients required to solve goals to story
******** Instantiating partially specified characters
******** Opportunistic goals found
****** Each time new scene is created it's checked for consistency with author goals
****** Memory is queried via TRAM
******* Transform, recall, adapt methods
**** Mexica - Perez y Perez, 1999
***** Uses story actions
****** lifted from old stories
****** with pre/post conditions
***** Engagement
****** Story world context
******* describes emotional links and tensions between characters
******* act like rules during engagement
Action added to plot if a SWC for that cation can be found that matches plot so far
******* SWC's not action pre/posts used to choose next action
***** Reflection phase
****** Checks for novelty, coherence, and interest
****** If story too similar or lacking in interest
******* Set guidelines for engagement
******** low level equivalent of author goals
****** coherence check only followed at end
******* actions that explicate character goals or tensions added at ending
**** Virtual storyteller - Theune et al 2003
**** Narrator in nn - Montford 2007
***** User controls main character
****** simple description of what he should do is input
***** System responds with "outcomes of characters actions"
***** Focus on focalization - order of actions
****** flashbacks, flash-forward, interleaving of events
****** handled by "focalizer worlds"
****** maintains different worlds containing individual users perspectives
******* can tell same story from different characters perspectives

** Good points
*** Looks at computational approaches to storytelling
*** Looks to relatively recent models of C?
*** Quick to define slippery things
**** Particular attention to way human C is modelled 
***** Look for features relevant to C
****** Focuses on:
******* new
******* unexpected
******* different
******* satisfy some goal
****** Claims natural phenomena are not C like sunsets
****** Systems must have an output
******* that can be perceived and evaluated
****** Novelty
******* from perspective of creator and audience
****** Unexpectedness
******* defeats expectations
******* derived from knowing what creator or other creators have done before
****** Useful/have some value
******* Notes that notions of value different across domains
******** And would probably drive very different forms of C
***** Talks about how all systems have IO and sometime feedback
****** Notes that perception of novelty can be influenced by providing new input
****** Feedback takes past outputs in to account
******* Same input fed multiple times in to system can produce different output

**** Defines storytelling
***** Highly complex intellectual product involving
****** time/space

**** C + storytelling is difficult because
***** Both have blurry definitions

**** Covers literary theory in accessible way
***** Pulls means of analysis from relevant discipline
***** Doesn't tell us loads we don't need to know

******* Serendipitous
****** To pursue this two meta-goals introduced
******* Current narrative goal
******* Find better narrative goal

**** Leobowitz's Universe 1983
***** Differs from Dehn in that story world comes first
***** Writers aid for TV soap opera with no recognisable ending
***** Dialogue/Natural language not handled
***** Partly automatic character generation
****** bulk left to user

****** Characters modelled as autonomous agents
******* Own emotions
******* Goals
******* perception of environment

*** Discussion
**** Creative process
**** Inventing stories
**** Creative process
***** who is creator
***** what is output
****** is output unexpected?
****** meets some goal?
****** relate them to inputs
****** is feedback contemplated?
****** ideally natural language
******* but systems focus on fabula

******* nn only does discourse - fabula generation down to user interactions
******** preprogrammed game file
******** succesive interactions with player
******** generate discourse
***** storytellers/story inventors
****** nn - story teller
****** rest are story inventors

**** Inventing stories - Fabula
***** Concerned that audience not involved 
****** Fabulist does focus on believability of stories
****** Mexica knows about previous stories
******* acts as a model of what audience knows
******* assists in development of novelty
******** hence p-creativity
******** no other systems guarantee this
***** Some systems model authoring process
****** Author, Universe, Minstrel and Mexica
****** Notes that these are more likely to tell us something about how humans address the task of writing
******* Mexica models Sharpels view on how authoring happens
***** Others on world simulation
****** Novel writer, Talespin, Fabulist and Virtual Storyteller
****** World first
******* Dehn's Author
******** World is built to justify discourse
****** World after
******* Lebowitz's Universe
******** world acts as guide to discourse
***** Deploys Ritchie's analysis
****** high on typicality

******** Ensuring basic expectations are met
********* Weekend party plot in Novel Writer
********* Author goals
********** Author
********** Minstrel
********* Optimal tension arcs in Mexica
********* Plot structure built in to Virtual Story Teller
******* Do not experiment with breaking genre conventions

****** Performs brief comparison of output to inspiring set
******* Notes that most systems perform badly
******** even Mexica which compares to previous stories
********* creates stories of type defined in inspiring set
******* Other systems need lots of or fully specified input
******** Fabulist
********* initial state
********* outcome state
******** Rest get just initial configuration of world
******** Minstrel
********* initial state
********* moral
******** Author
********* just author goals
***** Deploys Jennings
****** No systems display C autonomy
****** Since no systems are capable of evaluating own output
***** Deploys Boden
****** Notes that some systems may be capable of transfomational creativity
******* Dehn's Author
******** Can leverage serendipity
********* deviating from original goals
******* Universe 
******** generalizes plot fragments
******* Minstrels TRAMs
******** uses old knowledge to solve new problems
******* Fabulist 
******** planner can modif input world in order to meet goals
******** so transforms search space
******** fits with Boden and Sharples ideas that transforming constraints can be valuable

**** Telling stories - discourse
***** Creativity rates even lower for telling stories
***** nn focussed most on this
****** focus on clearly giving perspective of charcters
******* not creative use of language etc

*** Conclusions

**** Notes that systems are incomaptibele

***** due to differences in story representation

**** Notes that discourse and fabula should interact

**** Typical of particular genre

**** Only one system does novelty

**** social contexts of critics and creators and audience barely been considered 

**** Appropriate inputs might be important to perception of creativity

**** Doesn't perform systematic evaluation
***** Choosing instead to 
****** Identify particualr elements of systems
******* show insights in to strory telling


*** Points to work that needs to be done in the future
**** Storytellers could perhaps focus on model of reader

** Bad points
*** Makes assumptions about difference between value in 
**** Science -> Design -> Art
***** In design systems must fulfil requirements as well as aesthetic
****** I'm tempted to say aesthetic is just a requirement
****** I think they're correct re: difference across some domains
****** Not so radically different across disciplines

*** Makes claim that nature is not creative
**** I still think there's room to view evolution as C

*** Provides narrow definition of story
**** Time/space
***** Some stories play with perception of time and space
****** e.g. Vonnegut - Slaughter house five
**** Character knowledge/goals/intention/feelings/empathy
***** What if the main character is an insect, bit of bacteria, leaf blowing in wind?
**** Natural language - Couldn't we tell a story with code?
***** Code poems?

*** Could have gone straight to literary analysis
**** Allows for broader conception of stories
**** 


*** Clearly spells out limitations of some systems
*** Discusses possible future extensions of work?
*** Looks to predict future trends
*** Quick to announce CC research problems
**** Definitions of C and storytelling lack precision
** Questions
*** are we still just playing with words?
**** computers are stuck just playing with words?
* Veale, 2014 - The revolution will be automated
[[zotero://select/items/0_QKN4URR7][Veale, Tony. “RobotComix Catalogue,” 2014. http://robotcomix.com/comix/Catalogue/mobile/.]]
** What is CC?
*** the scientific study of the creative potential of computers.
*** Engineering study
how to build machines that create to a human standard.
*** Algorithmic analysis of human
How do humans create?
mind-as-computer metaphor
*** What does it mean to be creative in world where humans are not the only creators?
*** Not meta-creativity
**** Meta-creativity
When we create machines that can create for us
Humans construct systems to be creative on there behalf.
Humans and computational system work together
**** All creative systems are meta-creative
System creates for human
**** Some meta-creativity is merely generative
[[zotero://select/items/0_EH9MKAEW][Dan Ventura. “Mere Generation: Essential Barometer or Dated Concept?” Paris, 2016.]]
Continuum between MC and CC
** Strong vs weak computational creativity
"Distinction is clear in principle, but blurred in practice."
- Strong :: Fully autonomous machines that "own" their output.
     No human. Critique, rank and filter.
- Weak :: semi-autonomous to support greater creativity in humans.
     Cannot appreciate. Human filters. Still generative.

** Questions to ask of Creative systems
*** Who /owns/ the creation?
*** Who is the /main/ creative agent?
*** Can system /surprise/ or /surpass/ us?

** Creativity needs engagement
*** Can machines handle the unexpected?
Can a /rule-defined/ computational system genuinely /engage/ with a problem and
react sensibly to the truly unexpected?
**** If system relies on rules to handle the /unexpected/ is the unexpected really unexpected?
Where do Neural Nets etc live relative to this?
How do humans handle the unexpected?
** Creativity is a /folk notion/
*** No formula for creativity
*** social construct
Which can be explored in empirically with computational models.
** CC seeks to observe creativity
*** Understand criteria for applying "creative" label.
**** has no qualities that are necessarily present in all instances of creativity
Instead we tell each other narratives of creativity.
*** > knowledge of human psychology that a CCS draws upon, > likelyhood of human appreciation?
** Daniel Kahneman - Human cognition operates at 2 speeds
- System 1 :: Fast, eager, always on
  - Jumps to conclusions with minimal evidence
  - Underpins intuition
  - Blink response
  - Relies on shortcuts
    - Hence often misled
  - Primed elements can become fixations?
  - Automatic association hides ambiguity
    - Successful creator revives ambiguity by subverting system 1
- System 2 :: Slower, less eager, easily depleted
  - Analyses situation in more depth
  - Uses rules and conscious reasoning
  - More likely to be right
*** Creativity involves a "told-you-so" dialogue between 1 and 2
*** 1's unstated assumptions can push minds in to mental ruts
**** Escaping ruts with system 2 can yield "creative satisfaction".
** Mere-generation vs CC
*** Selection of outputs with
- Novelty
- Demonstrable utility
Quality of computer generated output lies as much with what is /not-generated/
or is /not-selected/ as what is.
** Exploratory creativity
A creator explores /an established space of ideas/
Find /goal-state/ that is novel and valuable.
Requires:
- state space
- value metric
If novel route is taken to goal state it is /doubly creative/
*** Transform the state space, changing its rules
Why? Find new areas of production unreachable in others
*** Creative explorers can have problems
- lost in valueless area - wrong part of the space.
- might be /mislead/ by /faulty intuitions/
** Boden's H and P creativity
- P :: Original to creator
- H :: Original to society
** Imitation game
We are not in the business of building fake humans!
Turing style test - emphasises fooling rather than impressing evaluators.
*** A CC system that can discuss
- influences/inspiring examples
- motivations
- success
- failure

** Defining CC
"The philosophy, science and engineering of computational systems which, by
taking on particular /responsibilities/, exhibit behaviours that /unbiased
observers/ would deem to be creative."
*** Why redefine?
**** responsibilities
Keen to differentiate creativity support tools(CST) and CC.
CST do not have creative intent/behaviour.
Creative /responsibilities/ may be:
- application of aesthetic measures to asses value
- invention of processes for generating new material
- framing output
**** unbiased observers
Worried about unfair observations.
**** remove novelty and value
Would rather talk of impact as described in [[zotero://select/items/0_NSX6ECWA][Colton, Simon, A. Pease, and J. Charnley. “Computational Creativity Theory: The FACE and IDEA Descriptive Models.” In Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Computational Creativity, 90–95, 2011. http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc2011/proceedings/the_foundational/colton_1_iccc11.pdf.]]
Does not rule out creativity totally different from that of people.

*** CC is about
 "the devolution of creative responsibility from human to machine – with
 implementations that create and assess artefacts of their own."
** discuss state of the art
*** Claim field differs from AI because
"It seems to us inappropriate to describe the composition of a sonata, or the painting of a picture as a problem to be solved, and so techniques that essentially come down to optimisation or classiﬁcation are inappropriate."
*** Focus on self-evaluation
*** interaction between generative systems
*** generate new artifacts from learnt model
** Evaluation
Measuring, comparing, contrasting
/High level validation/ i.e. selling artifacts rarely achieved
*** Distinguish between tests that asses:
**** Cultural value of artifacts
**** Sophistication of system behaviour
*** It is not adequate to perform blind tests
- Can encourage pastiche
- Focus on particular styles - naive
- "process is of at least equal importance to product in modern art evaluation."
*** Curation coefficient
- How much output is thrown away by developer?
- Is system behaving "as a muse, rather than a creative collaborator"?
*** Creativity tripod
It's proposed that in order to be creative a system needs to be:
- Skillful
- Appreciative
- Imaginative
*** /Latent heat/ effect
"as the creative responsibility given to systems increases, the value of its output does not (initially) increase"
Refernce to substances about to undergo state change!
*** Amount of input should be considered when evaluating output.
*** FACE stuff
** CC future
** ?
Is it really possible to be an un-baised observer - probably psychology literature
Is CC actual about getting computers to express bias
Why isn't painting a picture "just a problem to be solved"?
Is Naivety always bad?

* Affective Evolutionary Music Composition with MetaCompose
** Purpose
*** Produce loop-able compositions that
**** Non-repetitive
**** dynamically change the affective expression
***** i.e. can express many different moods in contrast to previous work which only focuses on 1.
**** Mood is identifiable
** Detailed components
**** Composition generator
Creates "basic abstraction" of music used by /real-time affective music composer/
Creates metaphor
Basic outline
**** Real-time affective music composer
Ensemble free to interpret piece
**** Maintains DB of previous compositions - allows scoring of novelty
** GA
*** Mood classified by end users in bi-dimensional affective space
*** MOO - Multi-objective optimisation
**** NGSA-2 - produces diverse non-dominated solutions
***** group population in to sub-populations based on pareto-dominance?
***** is this just a way of writing fitness function ?
**** FI-2POP :: Feasible/Infeasible 2-Population GA
Surely this has been named before?
***** two populations maintained
****** feasible
pass binary conditions - constraints
****** infeasible
don't pass binary conditions
not evaluated by objective function
***** avoids focus on sub-optimal solutions
***** free to explore boundary regions
** Composition generation
- Composition :: abstraction of music piece missing some details.
  + Not complete score
  + Leave room for details
*** graph based chord sequence generator
Just a random walk over a directed graph with user specified constraints
*** search based melody generator
FI-2POP
Rhythmic information generated randomly
Strictly diatonic melodies
1-8 notes per chord
Variations added later - for mood
**** Constraints
***** Feasability score generated with three boolean fn
****** No leaps bigger 5th
****** Minimum amount of 2nd leaps met
****** Every note pitch must be different to previous one
*** pattern based accompaniment generator
**** basic rhythm
***** db of rhythms
***** euclidean rhythms
***** combined with melody notes
**** arpeggio
** Mood interpretation
Farts out MIDI
*** Mood expression theory
**** Influences for mood - Liu et al.
***** Intensity - volume
High arousal = high volume
***** Timbre
Brighter timbre = Positive valence
***** Rhythm
****** Strength
How much mix is dominated by bass/drums - valence dependant
****** Regularity
****** Tempo
Arousal dependant
***** Dissonance
Music theory is a bit wrong!
More dissonance = more negative affect expression
Out of key notes added = more negative valence
****** Is modality chosen based on pre-existing concept of modality affect?
***** Meta-compose archive
Allows association of generated material with levels/bosses etc.
Allows measure of similarity to previous material to be calculated.
** Evaluation
*** Components of system replaced with random generators
*** Users asked to rate using
**** Pleasantness
How pleasing piece is
**** Randomness
Does piece have coherent structure?
**** harmoniousness
Supposed to be less subjective than pleasantness
**** Interestingness
** Review
*** Goals and contributions
**** Goals are clearly stated.
Yes
**** Do contributions meat the goals?
Apparently so - although "well-composed" drops off with negative valence
*** Presentation
**** Is paper well written/organised?
+ Discussion of document structure at start
+ Good non-technical introduction
+ Background in music provided
+ Background in mood provided
**** Uses standard terminology?
+ transformational vs generative
+ valence vs arousal
**** Can work be replicated?
- Not 100% on mood space - need to look at previous work
*** Evaluation
**** Careful enough?
***** Positives
+ valence vs arousal axis seem well thought out
+ feasible/infeasible groups potentially stops sub-optimal solutions
***** Negatives
+ possibly relies on evaluators having music expertise - i.e. harmoniousness
+ did users often analyse at least 5 clips?
+ chap is really confused about 5ths
**** Systematic experiments?
+ crowd sourcing of previous terms
**** Careful theoretical analysis?
Measures for musical evaluation seem a little naive - haven't musicoloists come up with something better?
Introducing negative valence drops "well-composed" measure. Not sure I buy explanation
**** Evidence of generality?
Yes. Although not mentioned.
*** References
**** Discusses relevant earlier work?
***** Similarities
Some focus on multiple moods - Montieth
Loughran, Dahlstedt, CM book use EAs
Some systems real-time
MetaCompose uses distance metric.
Livingstone - defines dynamic music environment
***** Differences
Systems that only focus on one mood - Robertson, CHARM
Montieth uses statistical models
Chan and Ventura - just change harmonisation
Livingstone - uses predefined tracks
Mezzo uses leitmotifs
***** Progress
**** Does it give proper credit?
Yes
*** Discussion
**** Limitations
+ melody could be included in distance measure made with MetaCompose archive
**** Implications
Discussed in introduction
**** Future work
Better model for evaluation
*** General
**** Significant
I think so
**** Technically sound
Probably - I am surprised misunderstanding of 5th didn't show through in evaluation
**** Is GPEM appropriate?
Yup.

** Summary
We can measure consciousness through compression
Is the world divided in to mind and matter?
We don't need to know why consciousness exists in order to measure it.

"Explaining why consciousness exists at all is not necessary in order to make progress in revealing its material basis – to start building explanatory bridges from the subjective and phenomenal to the objective and measurable."

*** Chalmer's distinction
**** Easy problem
How does brain give rise to perception, cognition, learning and behaviour?
**** Hard problem
Why and how should that be associated with consciousness?
Why do we have an inner universe?

*** Seth's real problem
**** Account for properties of consciousness in terms of biological mechanisms
***** Biologists just talk about underlying mechanisms

"life is not 'one thing' - rather, it has many potentially separable aspects"
***** "distinguishing different aspects of consciousness, and mapping their phenomenological properties"
***** distinguish between conscious

**** Difference between being conscious and awake
***** Measuring how conscious
****** can't be done through overall brain activity

******* TMS/EEG show pulse echos
******** In dreamless sleep

*** "And this returns us one last time to Descartes. In dissociating mind from body, he argued that non-human animals were nothing more than ‘beast machines’ without any inner universe. In his view, basic processes of physiological regulation had little or nothing to do with mind or consciousness. I’ve come to think the opposite. It now seems to me that fundamental aspects of our experiences of conscious selfhood might depend on control-oriented predictive perception of our messy physiology, of our animal blood and guts. We are conscious selves because we too are beast machines – self-sustaining flesh-bags that care about their own persistence."

** Summary
natural selection need not favour /veridical perceptions/?
"Interface games" - evolutionary games where perceptual strategies compete.
Veridical strategies driven to extinction by strategies that are tuned to *utility* rather than *objective reality*.
** Content
*** Introduction
**** perception, in general, estimates the truth?
***** Lehar (2003) 
****** "The primary function of perception [is] that of generating a fully spatial virtual-reality replica of the external world in an internal representation."
***** Geisler and Diehl (2003) 
****** "(perceptual) estimates that are nearer the truth have greater utility"
***** Palmer (1999) 
****** "evolutionarily speaking, visual perception is useful only if it is reasonably accurate."
***** Yuille and Bulthoff (1996)
****** we evolved to "match the structure of the world and the coding scheme provided by nature."
**** Modelling perception
***** Knill & Richards - Bayesian estimation is good
****** perception estimates truth
****** terms used in computation of the brain, are shaped by selection, so that its estimates are accurate. As a result, the priors and likelihoods used by the brain accurately reflect the true priors and likelihoods in the world.
***** truer perception is fitter perception
****** Does evolutionary theory support this claims?
******* EG used to explore 
******** relative fitness of possible relations between Perception and Reality
********* truth can fare poorly when information is not free
********** costs for time and energy required to gather information can impair the fitness of truth
********* Interface promotes efficient interaction
********** hiding its structural and causal complexity
*********** dramatically trim the requirements for information and its concomitant costs in time and energy
*********** not required to model aspects of objective reality;
*********** more flexibility to model utility, and utility is all that matters in evolution.
****** What is true perception?
*** Models of perception
**** Perceptual strategies
***** Map W -> X - relationship between Perception and Reality
****** Naive realist
******* perception faithfully and exhaustively resembles reality.
******* X = W
****** scientific/critical realism
******* perception models part of reality not all
****** interface theory
******* perception need not, and in general does not, resemble any aspect of reality
******* perception can be useful because it is not true
******** just as desktop icon hides complexity of computer hardware
******* perception is species specific guide to action
******* strong/weak
******** strong
********* subset of things happening in the world
********* relationships amongst perceptions reflect relationships in reality
******** weak
********* bias perceptions based on utility
********* so long as hommorphism is maintained
******* Interface strategy
******** homomorphism needn't hold
******** perception need to faithfully model any aspect of reality
******** X not always in W
*** An elementary interface games
**** Infinite population
***** paired for competition
****** each agent must choose 1 of 3 territories
****** each territory contains two resources
******* which may or may not be correlated
******* quantity ranges from 1 - 100
******** sum of resource values is utility of territory
****** when agent chooses territory
******* utility of territory becomes agents fitness
****** agent that chooses second must select between remaining territories
****** each agent uses one of two strategies
***** simple strategy - critical realist
****** observes only one resource per territory
******* above below threshold - sees green and red
******** chooses between 2 green or 2 red at random
***** truth strategy - naive realist
****** sees exact quantity
******* chooses best available
***** seeing more data takes more time
