Interactive selection, based on visual perception of procedurally generated results, allows the user to direct simulated evolutions in preferred directions. Several examples using these methods have been implemented and are described. 3D plant structures are grown using fixed sets of genetic parameters. Images, solid textures, and animations are created using mutating symbolic lisp expressions. Genotypes consisting of symbolic expressions are presented as an attempt to surpass the limitations of fixed-length genotypes with predefined expression rules. It is proposed that artificial evolution has potential as a powerful tool for achieving flexible complexity with a minimum of user input and knowledge of details.},

	abstract = {With the growth in digital representations of music, and of music stored in these representations, it is increasingly attractive to search collections of music. One mode of search is by similarity, but, for music, similarity search presents several difficulties: in particular, for melodic query support, deciding what part of the music is likely to be perceived as the theme by a listener, and deciding whether two pieces of music with different sequences of notes represent the same theme. In this paper we propose a three-stage framework for matching pieces of music. We use the framework to compare a range of techniques for determining whether two pieces of music are similar, by experimentally testing their ability to retrieve different transcriptions of the same piece of music from a large collection of MIDI files. These experiments show that different comparison techniques differ widely in their effectiveness; and that, by instantiating the framework with appropriate music manipulation and comparison techniques, pieces of music that match a query can be identified in a large collection.},

This aim is being pursued as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) project, with the hope that the technical difficulties overcome along the way will lead to new and improved generic AI techniques. It is also being pursued as a sociological project, where the effect of software which might be deemed as creative is tested in the art world and the wider public. In this chapter, we summarise our progress so far in The Painting Fool project. To do this, we first compare and contrast The Painting Fool with software of a similar nature arising from AI and graphics projects. We follow this with a discussion of the guiding principles from Computational Creativity research that we adhere to in building the software. We then describe five projects with The Painting Fool where our aim has been to produce increasingly interesting and culturally valuable pieces of art. We end by discussing the issues raised in building an automated painter, and describe further work and future prospects for the project. By studying both the technical difficulties and sociological issues involved in engineering software for creative purposes, we hope to help usher in a new era where computers routinely act as our creative collaborators, as well as independent and creative artists, musicians, writers, designers, engineers and scientists, and contribute in meaningful and interesting ways to human culture.},

takes a dim view of supposedly creative systems that
operate by mere generation. However, what exactly this

the idea of requiring systems to exceed this standard is
problematic. Here, we revisit the question of mere generation
and attempt to qualitatively identify what constitutes
exceeding this threshold. This exercise leads to
the conclusion that the question is likely no longer relevant
for the field and that a failure to recognize this is
likely detrimental to its future health.},

	title = {Searching for {Surprise}},
	abstract = {Inspired by the notion of surprise for unconventional discovery
in computational creativity, we introduce a general
search algorithm we name surprise search. Surprise search is
grounded in the divergent search paradigm and is fabricated
within the principles of metaheuristic (evolutionary) search.
The algorithm mimics the self-surprise cognitive process of
creativity and equips computational creators with the ability
to search for outcomes that deviate from the algorithm’s expected
behavior. The predictive model of expected outcomes
is based on historical trails of where the search has been and
some local information about the search space. We showcase
the basic steps of the algorithm via a problem solving (maze
navigation) and a generative art task. What distinguishes surprise
search from other forms of divergent search, such as the
search for novelty, is its ability to diverge not from earlier and
seen outcomes but rather from predicted and unseen points in
the creative domain considered.},

	abstract = {In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked for belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on.
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
When data are not labeled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The clustering algorithm which provides an improvement to the support vector machines is called support vector clustering and is often used in industrial applications either when data is not labeled or when only some data is labeled as a preprocessing for a classification pass.},

abstract = "Abstract We present a formalism for combining logic programming and its flavour of nondeterminism with probabilistic reasoning. In particular, we focus on representing prior knowledge for Bayesian inference. Distributional logic programming (Dlp), is considered in the context of a class of generative probabilistic languages. A characterisation based on probabilistic paths which can play a central role in clausal probabilistic reasoning is presented. We illustrate how the characterisation can be utilised to clarify derived distributions with regards to mixing the logical and probabilistic constituents of generative languages. We use this operational characterisation to define a class of programs that exhibit probabilistic determinism. We show how Dlp can be used to define generative priors over statistical model spaces. For example, a single program can generate all possible Bayesian networks having N nodes while at the same time it defines a prior that penalises networks with large families. Two classes of statistical models are considered: Bayesian networks and classification and regression trees. Finally we discuss: (1) a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm that can take advantage of the defined priors and the probabilistic choice points in the prior programs and (2) its application to real-world machine learning tasks.

Frame-wise spectral-domain features are used as inputs to train a deep neural network for multi label classification in this work. The model is evaluated with recordings from realistic everyday environments and the obtained overall accuracy is 63.8\%. The method is compared against a state-of-the-art method using non-negative matrix factorization as a pre-processing stage and hidden Markov models as a classifier. The proposed method improves the accuracy by 19\% percentage points overall.},

	abstract = {Pareto efficiency, or Pareto optimality, is a state of allocation of resources in which it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off. The term is named after Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923), an Italian engineer and economist who used the concept in his studies of economic efficiency and income distribution. The concept has applications in academic fields such as economics, engineering, and the life sciences.
Pareto improvement is defined to be a change to a different allocation that makes at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off, given a certain initial allocation of goods among a set of individuals. An allocation is defined as "Pareto efficient" or "Pareto optimal" when no further Pareto improvements can be made.
Pareto efficiency is a minimal notion of efficiency and does not necessarily result in a socially desirable distribution of resources: it makes no statement about equality, or the overall well-being of a society. The notion of Pareto efficiency can also be applied to the selection of alternatives in engineering and similar fields. Each option is first assessed under multiple criteria and then a subset of options is identified with the property that no other option can categorically outperform any of its members.},

	abstract = {By, Brian L Troutwine
Building computer systems that are reliable is hard. The functional programming community has invested a lot of time and energy into up-front-correctness guarantees: types and the like. Unfortunately, absolutely correct software is time-consuming to write and expensive as a result. Fault-tolerant systems achieve system-total reliability by accepting that sub-components will fail and planning for that failure as a first-class concern of the system. As companies embrace the wave of "as-a-service" architectures, failure of sub-systems become a more pressing concern. Using examples from heavy industry, aeronautics and telecom systems, this talk will explore how you can design for fault-tolerance and how functional programming techniques get us most of the way there.},

	abstract = {Let's talk about Google DeepMind's Wavenet! This piece of work is about generating audio waveforms for Text To Speech and more. Text To Speech basically means that we have a voice reading whatever we have written down. The difference in this work, is, however that it can synthesize these samples in someone's voice provided that we have training samples of this person speaking.
