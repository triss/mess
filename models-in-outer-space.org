* Evolving societies of mind
Minsky described a model of human intelligence that operates through the interaction of simple mindless agents.
Human's have been known to give rise to behaviour inside particular conceptual spaces to which we subjectively apply the label of creativity.
Whether or not this model is complete for humans is still an open question however some parts of the brain/body do clearly display this isomorphism.
To some extent this hasn't 

** Models
*** Any function
**** Trained models
**** Hand coded
**** Interact via uniform system
***** Converting everything to vectors makes most sense?
****** everything can be represented as sequence of floats
******* fun with hyperdimensional socks
****** native language of fuzzier systems like NN?

*** Schema/Types
**** (de)composable
***** if model is to sort flags by colour
****** images by colour
******* sorts Xs by Y
******** sorts Xs by Y
********* sorts Xs by Y
********** Fns Xs by Y
**** often ignored!!!!
**** Maybe WSDL will do?
***** probably spec type thing

*** logging information
**** Evolutionary histories
***** Potential to analyse
******* Most successful route of representation's
******* Expense of constructing can be derived
***** Because of framing
****** finger print hiding not something i want to mimic
******* a deficit of human creativity is that it often hard for progenitor to explain what he did?
******** machines can do creativity better? i.e. tell us how it happened
**** How successful/valuable?
**** How costly is it to run?

*** Harnesses for different types
**** i.e. markov/neural network/GP
***** things can be run in many ways
****** applied to scalars
****** 'iterated' over a sequence
******* fold/reduce
******* filter
******* map
******* group-by
******* some
**** Run time for models
***** Potentially models them selves!!!!

** Embodiment
*** Senses
**** Web Services
***** coerced to vector input
**** Evaluation methods for input and own output
*** Limbs
**** Create outputs
***** Map vector to image, sound, sentance, lisp expression!, sausage roll etc.

** Memory/training data
*** As much if training data as possible
**** to test new models against
*** It's models
